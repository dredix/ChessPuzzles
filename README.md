# Chess Puzzles

This project is a collection of chess problems and algorithms in java, used in an undergraduate software engineering course. Its purpose was to illustrate basic OOP concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) using problems both easy to explain and translate into a computer program.

The problems included so far are [Eight Queens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) amd [Knight's Tour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_Tour). The only algorithm implemented during the original lecture was [backtracking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking). My plan is to extend this project so it can be used as a playground for modern optimisation techniques and perhaps advanced heuristics.

Also because I like chess puzzles.
